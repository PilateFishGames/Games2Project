Hello,
Thank you for purchasing Space Insects.
Normal and specular maps are also added, but i found them unneccessary.
Animation phases: 
0-30 idle (flying, hovering, whatever...)
35-50 attack

The cocoon has only hovering animation. I guess it is some kind of explosive cocoon.

If you have any problems or want to share your opinions, you can write to kalamona01@gmail.com.

Cheers,
Gergely Zsolnay
